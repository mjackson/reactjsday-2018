This repo contains the slides + demo code from my keynote talk at ReactJS Day 2018 in Verona, Italy. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The demo is a React Router clone that was live-coded during the talk. The purpose was to give attendees a better sense for what React Router does for them and how it accomplishes this.

The code is in [`src/App.js`](src/App.js). To run it, just do:

```bash
yarn start
```
